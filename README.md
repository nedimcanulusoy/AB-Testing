### Problem

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, 'average bidding', as an alternative to the existing bidding type
called 'maximum bidding'. One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to run an
A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding. The A/B test has been going on for 1 month and
now bombabomba.com is waiting for you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success criterion for
Bombabomba.com is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.

### Dataset

In this dataset, which includes the website information of a company, there is information such as the number of
advertisements that users see and click, as well as earnings information from here. There are two separate data sets,
the control and test groups. These datasets are in separate sheets of the ab_testing.xlsx excel. Maximum Bidding was
applied to the control group and Average Bidding was applied to the test group.

There are `4 different variables`, around `40 observations` in the dataset.

    Impression : Ad views
    Click      : Number of clicks on the displayed ad
    Purchase   : Number of products purchased after ads clicked
    Earning    : Earnings after purchased products
